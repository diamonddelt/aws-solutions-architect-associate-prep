# Elastic Transcoder

A cloud-based media `transcoder`, which converts media files from one format into another format that can be played on any smartphone, tablet, PC, or video-capable device.

Elastic Transcoder has many presets for popular output formats, so the user does not necessarily need to know what the best output format to transcode audio or video into for a particular device is.

You pay based on the minutes you are transcoding media, and at what resolution/bitrate/etc you are transcode. In other words, if you transcode at higher media qualities, you will pay more per minute.
