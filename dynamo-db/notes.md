The most common and popular NoSQL solution on AWS. Stores documents as JSON objects with key/value pairs. Used for `unstructured` data - i.e. non-relational.



## Exam Tips

1. When you think of Dynamo DB, think `single digit latency` - you would always choose a NoSQL solution for a `scalable and fully managed database` that can be in `multiple regions` at once. It is very fast.
