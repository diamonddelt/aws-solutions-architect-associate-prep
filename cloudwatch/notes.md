# Cloudwatch

## What does it do?

CloudTrail logs who asked for what in the API, while CloudWatch tracks metrics and related performance events. You can install this on EC2 instances for example (if it doesn't already come installed), and configure it to `collect custom performance and resource metrics in real-time. This is the AWS flavor of Resource Monitor/NewRelic, or APM (application performance monitoring)`
