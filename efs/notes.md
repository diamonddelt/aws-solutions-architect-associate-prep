# Elastic File System (EFS)

## What does it do?

Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) provides simple, scalable file storage for use with Amazon EC2 instances. This works like a `cloud-based NAS that you can attach multiple EC2 instances at once`. This is `in contrast to EBS`, which acts like a local mounted hard disk drive, and `can only be attached to one EC2 instance at a time.`
